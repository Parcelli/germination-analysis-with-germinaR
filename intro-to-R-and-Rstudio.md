# Introduction to R and Rstudio

## What are R and Rstudio
R is a programming language widely used for statistics and data analysis in various fields.
R studio is a software interface that makes it easier to write R scripts and interact with the R software.

## Why use R ?
* **Reproducibility**

  R promotes reproducible research.  
  By writing your analysis as an R code you create a complete and transparent record of your analysis from data import to final results. This means that you or anyone else can reproduce the same results using the same data and script.Reproducibility is now a key requirement for most funders and journals.
    
* **Publlication quality plots**
  
  R has powerful visualization tools designed for creating high quality plots. Packages such a ggplot2 allow you to create clean, customizable and publication ready figures .

  
* **Less point and click**
  
  Unlike gaphical user interface (GUI) software, R does not depend on remebering which buttons to click or the order in which they were clicked.
  Instead your entire analysis is written as a script. To repeat or update the analysis , you simply run the script again ensuring consistency and reducing human error.
  
* **Strong and supportive Community**

  R has a large and supportive community. If you get stuck , help is widely available through platforms such as:
  - Stack Overflow
  - Rstudio community
  - Github
  - Blogs and tutorials
  This makes learning and troubleshooting much easier, especially for beginners.
